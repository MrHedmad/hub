title: "Hi, I'm Luca"
---

I'm a Data Steward and bioinformatician based in Turin, Italy.

I've worked with data all my professional life and I am keenly aware of the pains and pleasures of doing so.
During my PhD I've studied data preservation, archival and stewardship, with particular emphasis on research data in the biological field.
I've written multiple Data Management Plans used in several projects, including some large European grants, as well as the Data Management Policy at the Turin Cell Physiology Lab.

I firmly believe that we can do better science if we work in the open and transparently.
Data is science's lifeblood, and must be treated with the dedication and respect it deserves.
This is why I strongly support Open Science, and I wish to devote my career to it.

Some examples of my efforts in this regard include:
- I created and am the chairman of [the Open Science Community Torino](http://osc.to/), a community devoted to increasing the adoption of Open Science practices in an around Turin;
- I maintain the [Data Stewardship Knowledgebase](http://dsk.hedmad.eu/), a repository of information and resources for upcoming and experienced data stewards;
- I created [Kerblam!](https://kerblam.dev/) to package data science projects of any size for reproducibility's sake;
- All my past and future work is published as soon as it is created, most commonly in my [Github page](https://github.com/MrHedmad) or my current laboratory's Github page ([TCP-Lab](https://github.com/TCP-Lab)).

## What I can do

I'm adept at working with data, including its storage, formatting, statistical analysis, modelling, documentation and preservation.
I'm especially skilled in working with genomic data, including RNA-Seq and mutational analysis.

I'm an expert library and tool programmer in R, Python and Rust, with a propension for functional programming.
I've coded [small, reusable libraries](https://github.com/MrHedmad/bonsai), [project management tools](https://kerblam.dev), as well as numerous data [wrangling](https://github.com/MrHedmad/metasplit), [retrieval](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/MTP-DB), [conversion](https://github.com/MrHedmad/panid) and [analysis](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/bioTEA) tools.
I'm familiar with most mainstream version control tools (e.g. Git), as well as collaboration platforms (e.g. GitHub, Trello, etc...).

I'm not a web developer, but I've created this website as well as others ([kerblam.dev](https://kerblam.dev), [the OSCT's homepage](http://osc.to/) and [handbook](https://handbook.osc.to), [the DSK](https://dsk.hedmad.eu/) and [my blog](https://blog.hedmad.eu)) and know how to use static site generators like [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as well as how to write basic HTML and CSS.

I routinely work with databases, and know my way around SQL.
I've created a [database for cell membrane transporters](https://github.com/TCP-Lab/MTP-DB) which can regenerate itself by pulling data from other databases and parse it with heuristics.
This also means I'm adept at working with APIs.

I can manage and moderate online and offline communities and have done so in the past, a key example being the OSCT, its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Sv9BCTsXDh) and the Turin Cell Physiology Lab's private Discord server.

I am a [nanopublication](https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/) publisher, and I've published nanopublications in the past.

I know how to use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) as well as the more modern [typst](https://typst.app/) typographical systems to create beautiful documents quickly and reliably.
Find [an example here](https://github.com/OSCTorino/generate-certificates).
My Curriculum Vitae is created with custom Typst code, for example.

## Academic achievements, degrees and scientific publications

I have a Bachelor's in Biology and a Masters' in Cellular and Molecular Biology.
I'm currently a PhD candidate in Complex Systems for quantitative biomedicine, and I'm planning to obtain my doctorate by the end of 2025.

I have obtained the certification of Data Steward by attending the [CUAP Data Stewardship course](https://hpc4ai.unito.it/cuap-data-steward/) held by the University of Torino in 2024.
